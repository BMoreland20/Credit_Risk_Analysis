# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview: 

For this week we are using a data set from LendingClub to use supervised machine learning to determine an applicantâ€™s credit risk.

To do this we used Random Over Sample and SMOTE algorithms to oversample, while then using cluster centroids to the under sample.  After this was completed, we then used both Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier machine learning models to predict credit risk.

## Results:
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary:

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
